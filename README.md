# EdgeWorkloadsTraces

Paper: [IMC'21] From Cloud to Edge: A First Look at Public Edge Platforms.

*Dataset list*

- [x] **ENS-small**: The data of 14 edge nodes of China's largest public edge platform during June 2020, including CPU rate, uplink/downlink bandwidth, and affiliation. *Both CPU and bandwidth trace are recorded at a granularity of 5 minutes.*
- [ ] **ENS-full**: The data of 139 edge nodes of China's largest public edge platform during June 2020, including CPU rate, uplink/downlink bandwidth, and affiliation. (*In this data set, we additionally  provide three-month continuous records for bandwidth trace, but the granularity is 1 hour.*)


## Dataset description

This dataset contains the workloads traces (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth) at virtual machine (VM) granularity from a large-scale edge cloud platform in China.
